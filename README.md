Project 150

## Ball recieving

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Ball recieving" project developed as part of the Project Work 1 course (CSE 150). The game is implemented in C++ and designed to run as a console application on a computer.

## Game Description

The "Ball recieving" is a classic game where players control a player on a linear way, moving te player's avatar to catch randomly dropping balls. As the player catches the ball, it adds point, presenting a challenge to the player. The main goal is to achieve the highest score possible by collecting balls without missing any.

## Controls

- right: r or l - for controlling the player's direction.

## Obstacle

The primary obstacle in the game is the ball touching the ground. It leads to the end of the game.

## Development Goals

The key development goals include implementing essential game features such as user input handling, random food generation, player movement mechanics, missing the ball detection, and a scoring system. The project emphasizes the use of fundamental programming concepts and relevant data structures.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Fundamental Programming Concepts:** Gain a deeper understanding and application of fundamental programming concepts in a real-world project setting.

2. **Problem-Solving Skills:** Develop problem-solving skills through the challenges of game development, including handling user input and designing game mechanics.

3. **User Input Handling and Game Mechanics:** Acquire experience in handling user input and implementing core game mechanics for an interactive and engaging user experience.

4. **Algorithm Implementation:** Implement basic algorithms for collision detection and score tracking, enhancing algorithmic thinking skills.

5. **Teamwork and Collaboration:** Enhance teamwork and collaboration skills through group project work as part of Team TwoPointers.
